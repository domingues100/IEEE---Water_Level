These are the codes used: Class.ipynb, Regress.ipynb, OD_RCNN.ipynb, OD_RETINANET.ipynb, SN1.ipynb, SN2.ipynb

The images originally used are located inside the "pool dataset" folder this repo: https://github.com/domingues100/Water-Level-Detection-Datasets, along with the original .json file. Additionally, the file converted to CSV is in this repository under the name "instances_default.csv."

The original images need to be resized before being used. For detection codes, resize to 384x384, and for Siamese networks, classification, and regression, resize to 224x224.
